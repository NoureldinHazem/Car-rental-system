A web application for car rental was done using php, javascript, MYSQL database, CSS, Html.</br>
The website have 2 types of people (client,admin).Each of them has different authorities.</br>
It allows the client to book available cars from different cities and pay it online.</br>
It allows the admin to add and edit any car and to get and print reports and information about cars, clients, and reservations.</br></br>

This was the final project of database course.</br></br>
The project was done by:
1. Nour el-din hazem
2. Youssef hassan
3. Youssef sabry
4. Ingy el-sakhawy</br></br>

The project has many files that are not connected yet to the web application as we were trying to put the backed and frontend of each part in separete files but error occured.So, we will try to fix this soon. (The project is working normally)
